# Google Analytics Setup Instructions

Your quiz is now ready for Google Analytics tracking! Here's how to complete the setup:

## Step 1: Create a Google Analytics Account

1. Go to https://analytics.google.com/
2. Click "Start measuring" (or sign in if you have an account)
3. Create a new account or select an existing one
4. Set up a new property:
   - Property name: "Personality Pawtest" (or whatever you prefer)
   - Select your timezone and currency
   - Click "Next"

## Step 2: Set Up a Data Stream

1. Choose "Web" as your platform
2. Enter your website URL (where you'll host the quiz)
3. Name the stream: "Personality Quiz"
4. Click "Create stream"

## Step 3: Get Your Measurement ID

After creating the stream, you'll see a **Measurement ID** that looks like:
```
G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

## Step 4: Add Your Measurement ID to the Quiz

1. Open the `pixel-personality-quiz-updated.html` file
2. Find this section near the top (around line 8-9):
   ```html
   <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
   <script>
       window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
       function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
       gtag('js', new Date());
       gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
   </script>
   ```
3. Replace **both** instances of `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID
4. Save the file

## Step 5: View Your Analytics

Once the quiz is live and people start taking it, you can view analytics at:
https://analytics.google.com/

### What Gets Tracked:

✅ **Page views** - Every time someone loads the quiz
✅ **Quiz started** - When someone clicks "Start Test"
✅ **Quiz completed** - When someone finishes, including their result (MBTI type and animal)
✅ **Quiz restarted** - When someone clicks "Restart Quiz"

### Viewing Your Data:

- **Real-time visitors**: Reports > Realtime
- **Total visits**: Reports > Engagement > Pages and screens
- **Custom events**: Reports > Engagement > Events
  - Look for: `quiz_started`, `quiz_completed`, `quiz_restarted`
- **Result breakdown**: Click on `quiz_completed` event to see which animals/MBTI types are most common

### Common Result Parameters:

When someone completes the quiz, Analytics tracks:
- `result_type`: The MBTI type (e.g., "ENFP", "ISTJ")
- `result_animal`: The animal result (e.g., "Golden Retriever", "Black Cat")

## Troubleshooting:

**Not seeing data?**
- Wait 24-48 hours for data to populate (real-time should show immediately)
- Check that your Measurement ID is correct in both places
- Make sure the quiz is actually hosted online (not just opened as a local file)
- Verify in your browser's developer console that there are no errors

**Privacy Note:**
Google Analytics is GDPR-compliant when configured properly. It tracks anonymized data and doesn't collect personal information from your quiz takers.
